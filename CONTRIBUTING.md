# Oxygen Contributing Guidelines
Mostly, just keep in mind:
1. Follow the Code of Conduct, which governs both development of Oxygen and the Oxygen club Discord server
2. If your Pull Request does not get merged, don't even think about force pushing.
3. Making a development fork is ok, just don't pretend it is the official upstream.
